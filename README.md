# 🌐 Ritik Yadav's Developer Portfolio

This is my personal developer portfolio, built to reflect my technical strengths, design sensibilities, and professional journey. I’m **Ritik Yadav**, currently working as an **Application Developer at IBM**, with a deep passion for building modern, responsive web applications with clean UI/UX and impactful user experience.

This site is not just a digital resume — it's a full-stack project built from the ground up using modern technologies and principles like component-based design, animation, SEO, and performance optimization.

### 🧠 Purpose of the Project

As a developer who believes in “learning by building,” I created this portfolio to:

- ✅ Build a pixel-perfect, performant UI using modern front-end tools
- ✅ Create a central hub for my blog, project case studies, and contact information
- ✅ Strengthen my grasp on animation, layout systems, and developer-focused design
- ✅ Prepare for remote roles in top-tier companies in US/EU markets
